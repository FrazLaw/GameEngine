I'm creating a game engine along with an online tutorial from The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw)!

I'm looking to properly get into some real C++ projects and get away from just leetcoding so we'll see how this goes...

All files are created in visual studio 2017; I'm working on creating a stand alone, self-compiled version that can run on another device.
